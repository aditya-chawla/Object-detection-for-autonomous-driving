# Object-detection-for-autonomous-driving
Deep learning–based 2D object detection for autonomous driving using Faster R-CNN and YOLOv8 trained on Waymo and KITTI datasets. Includes mixed-dataset training, model benchmarking (mAP, recall, latency), and analysis of performance trade-offs for real-time perception.
